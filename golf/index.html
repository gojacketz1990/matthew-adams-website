                    <p>What is the problem?
                    </p>
                    <p>Driving - mediocre, doing a lot of guiding the club instead of hitting it so losing distance.   Get the driver stuck behind me at times, working on that with a smart ball.</p>
                    <p>Ball Striking - atrocious right now.  Distance - bad, problem finding the low point of my swing, completely inconsistent.</p>
                    <p>Short Game (Minus putting) - Only thing keeping me competitive right now.  Short game is pretty good, probably need some practice but not far off.</p>
                    <p>Putting - putting is pretty good right now, distance control is good.   Could use a little more focus on lining putts up and not going off of memory.</p>
                    <p>Focus right now is on the backswing, keeping the club in front of me.   Making a full turn and then keeping the club in front of me on the way down and through.   Staying in posture.</p>

                    <p>What am I working on now?
                    </p>
                    <p>Backswing - using the Smart Ball for a bunch of practice swing to try to keep the club in front of my body.</p>
                    <p>Downswing - using the Bryson dropping the club into your right pocket with your right hand to get the club in the slot.</p>
                    <p>Downswing - getting a better impact position with the left wrist angles correct and the grooves looking down at the ball.  Getting a much better sound and feel now.</p>
