                    <p>First round yesterday, some progress. 81 - 37-44 so didn't finish very well.
                    </p>
                    <p>Driving - mediocre still.  Not really getting after the ball. </p>
                    <p>Ball Striking - a little better.  Hit seven greens.</p>
                    <p>Short Game (Minus putting) - pretty good yesterday, couple really nice par saves, one chip in for birdie.  Couiple that could have been saved but was off a bit.</p>
                    <p>Putting - good speed, good line yesterday.   Made quite a few putts.</p>
                    <p>Today I am working on one of Hogan's pressure points of the upper left arm against the chest.  Looking for more consistency.</p>
                    <p>Evaluation:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Driving:  15</li>
                            <li>Ball Striking:  15</li>
                            <li>Short Game: 4</li>
                            <li>Putting: 0</li>
                            <li>Current Handicap:  13.3</li>

                    </p>
                    <p>Backswing - using the Smart Ball for a bunch of practice swing to try to keep the club in front of my body.</p>
                    <p>Downswing - using the Bryson dropping the club into your right pocket with your right hand to get the club in the slot.</p>
                    <p>Downswing - getting a better impact position with the left wrist angles correct and the grooves looking down at the ball.  Getting a much better sound and feel now.</p>
                    <p>Current Handicap:  13.7</p>

                    <p>What is the problem?
                    </p>
                    <p>Driving - mediocre, doing a lot of guiding the club instead of hitting it so losing distance.   Get the driver stuck behind me at times, working on that with a smart ball.</p>
                    <p>Ball Striking - atrocious right now.  Distance - bad, problem finding the low point of my swing, completely inconsistent.</p>
                    <p>Short Game (Minus putting) - Only thing keeping me competitive right now.  Short game is pretty good, probably need some practice but not far off.</p>
                    <p>Putting - putting is pretty good right now, distance control is good.   Could use a little more focus on lining putts up and not going off of memory.</p>
                    <p>Focus right now is on the backswing, keeping the club in front of me.   Making a full turn and then keeping the club in front of me on the way down and through.   Staying in posture.</p>

                    <p>I was able to get my hands on a couple of dozen left dot Titleist V1s that I caught on sale this week.  The left dot are a penetrating golf ball that still has control around the green.   They are extremely hard to get and are a short run.   Should be interesting to see how it affects ball flight and distances on the golf course.
