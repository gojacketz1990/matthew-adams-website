            <h2>Hello, I am Matthew Adams</h2>
            <p>As an <a href='https://atsqa.org/certified-testers/profile/e07aafb19eae4afba290bca334c592eb'>ISTQB CTFL</a> certified Quality Assurance Lead and Automation Engineer from Marietta, Georgia I focus on embedding quality at every stage in the lifecycle.   I specialize in providing subject matter expertise, optimizing quality workflows and building robust automation frameworks,  My passion lies in designing meticulous testing strategies that minimize defects and optimize performance. Explore my approach to quality and connect with me.
            </p>
            <p>My background also includes extensive experience in performance testing enterprise applications, capacity planning and performance tuning across diverse architectures.
            </p>
            <p>I went to school to be a Mechanical Engineer and worked in my field for a while designing refrigerator handles which consisted of drawing using AutoCAD for about seven hours a day.   I had very little interaction with anyone else and it became monotonous and boring very quickly.  </p>

            <p>Myself and a few buddies were out having a couple drinks on a Friday night and one of my friends mentioned that he had just started a software company.  He said I would be perfect for a QA Engineering position that they had open but you don't really have any experience.   I had done some QA in the manufactoring industry in summers and having a firm grasp on engineering concepts I said to him "engineering is engineering".  I started three weeks later and never looked back.
            </p>
            <p>Over the next couple years I steered more towards the performance side of QA and did performance testing and capacity planning almost exclusively for a few years.  I could tune WebLogic, WebSphere and Apache Web Servers with the best of them.  Through companies going out of business I ended up at Turner Broadcasting as a contractor for 18 months doing performance testing (LoadRunner, Performance Center) on internal applications.  I left TBS for a year since the contractor time limit had been reached and came back a year later as a full time employee</p>

            <p>For the next 16 years we went through quite a lot of change at TBS.   We became Time Warner, then AT+T and then Warner Brothers Discovery.  Over the years there were dozens of layoffs including 2020 where 19 of 24 of our QA resources were let go as we mostly went with QA Leads and offshore QA resources.   In 2023 the QA Leads were eliminated and that was the end of a great journey.</p>

            <p>I used the time to do a few things, learning for one thing as I have gotten up to speed on many of the latest technologies including Playwright and Machine Learning.  I learned JavaScript and brushed up on Python. I became ISTQB CTFL certified which had always been a goal.  I am actually thinking of getting a couple more certifications such as Agile Testing and AI.</p>

            <p>I put samples of my Selenium/Python framework up on GitHub, for safe keeping and to showcase skills.    I took a React MERN cource and ended up developing an application that organizes and catalogs baseball/trading cards.   I spent quite a bit of time inputting my collection of baseball cards in the system.  I created a testing suite around the application, created two API testing suites (Vitest and Postman) and am currently working on the React Unit Testing.</p>

            <p>Next steps on my custom application are integrating AI to recognize cards and grab the information so the user doesn't have to input that.   This will speed up the process immensely.   I also need to create an admin page that allows me to customize the inputs based on yearly releases as the meta-data is very different from year to year, company to company, and release to release.</p>

            <p>Lately my interest in Machine Learning and getting into LLM Engineering and Agentic AI Engineering.  

            <p>I have done a lot in the past 18 months, I don't turn the TV on during the day unless there is a golf major being played.  I read a lot on LinkedIn QA and Machine Learning forums to stay up to date and see what challenges people are seeing in the real world.   </p>
   
            <p>On a personal note I am working pretty hard on my golf game and am chronicling my journey to become a better player.  I have bounced back and forth between a 7 and 12 the past couple of years and have set a goal to be a 5 or better by the end of summer 2026.   </p>
